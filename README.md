# Gene in Music

## Overview
Very simple projection of genes level transcrition (kind of barblot, genes on x, transcription lvl on y)
- use a scaterring transform to perform classification
- reorder genes to have good classification performance
- Play with frequencies (place gene modules close together, put space between faraway genes)

## Plan - Tier 1
  - [ ] Operational worfklow
  - [ ] Achieve good performance on binomial classification
  - [ ] Play with n > 2 targets (gct dataset)
  - [ ] Compare to classic UMAP + CLF approach
