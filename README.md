# Gene in Music

## Overview
Very simple projection of genes level transcrition (kind of barblot, genes on x, transcription lvl on y)
-> use a scaterring transform to perform classification
-> reorder genes to have good classification performance
-> Play with frequencies (place gene modules close together, put space between faraway genes)
